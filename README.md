# Linux-bash

Scripts for Linux

#To execute tasks quickly since the terminal with one word!

#Script for change version in php, this need to have previous install php and libraries, in this case is php 5.6 and php 7.0 

In my case, these scripts are in the directory: /usr/local/bin
All scripts need permisions of execution : sudo chmod +x "file";
